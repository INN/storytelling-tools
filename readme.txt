Allows seamless embedding for the Storytelling Tools

== Description ==

The Knight Lab at Northwestern University has created 4 storytelling tools to help make information meaningful and promote quality journalism, storytelling and content on the internet.

This plugin seamlessly integrates those tools into WordPress, using the methods listed below:

1. Timeline
Easy-to-make, beautiful timelines.
This plugin adds embed support for timelines created at http://timeline.knightlab.com/. Simply paste the URL to the timeline you've created, and WordPress will embed an iframe of the content in it's place.

2. StoryMap
Maps that tell stories.
This plugin adds embed support for storymaps created at https://storymap.knightlab.com/. Simply paste the URL to the storymap you've created, and WordPress will embed an iframe of the content in it's place.

3. Juxtapose
Easy-to-make frame comparisons.
This plugin adds embed support for image comparisons created at https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/. Simply paste the URL to the item you've created, and WordPress will embed an iframe of the content in it's place.

4. Soundcite
Seamless inline audio.
This plugin adds a shortcode that allows you to embed an mp3 file as an inline text within a story. The plugin will automatically include the Soundcite javascript file on pages using the shortcode (in order to create the audio player).
You can learn more and see examples of this tool in action at http://soundcite.knightlab.com/
